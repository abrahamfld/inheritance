Hello Mr. Hamouda Al-Asmar — peace be unto you and the blessings of God.

I've been holding this back for a long time, not sure if I should tell you or just ignore it. I kept thinking maybe it's better left unsaid, but after many thoughts and prayers, I truly believe you deserve to know. So today, I'm finally sharing what I've been carrying with me.

This is about a man from your country, Mr. Alex Al-Asmar, who was a business associate of Getchell Gold Corp., a private company. On February 2, 2015, he opened a fixed-deposit private account at my bank and deposited $8,500,000.00 (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). The funds were meant to start a car manufacturing company in your country.

Sadly, Mr. Alex Al-Asmar — a frequent traveler and businessman — passed away on January 19, 2020, as one of the victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. When he opened the account, he didn't mention any next of kin or heir. He was a widower — his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Al-Asmar, had also passed away, and they had no children. He never listed any relatives either.

Up to now, my bank's management is unaware of both his death and this account. I only know about it because of my position and responsibilities in reviewing accounts. As I'm sharing this with you, the only people aware of the situation are you and me — which means it can only be handled quietly between us.

Recently, the bank started a verification exercise for dormant and private deposit accounts. I knew this would happen, and that's why I've been struggling with whether to tell you or not. If the board finds out, the directors will simply claim the money for themselves. But when I came across your details, I felt it wasn't by chance.

Since you share the same last name and nationality as Mr. Alex Al-Asmar, I want to seek your cooperation to present you as his rightful next of kin. With my authority and that of the bank manager, the funds can be released to you safely. There is no risk — everything will be done under a legitimate arrangement that will fully protect you.

I am not a greedy person, so I propose we share the funds equally: 50% for you and 50% for me. My share will help me start a new project and support an orphanage. I only ask that you keep this completely confidential. Once I get a positive response from you , I'll  guide you through the process.
